# Avoid
git commit -m "fix stuff"
git commit -m "updates"
```

function showNextQuestion() { }

// Use meaningful variable names
const timeRemaining = 30; // Good

// Add comments for complex logic
// Calculate final score based on correct answers and time bonus
const finalScore = correctAnswers * 10 + timeBonus;
```

### CSS

```css
/* Use clear, descriptive class names */
.question-container { }
.answer-button { }
.score-display { }

/* Group related styles */
/* Game Layout */
.game-container { }
.question-area { }

/* Buttons */
.btn-primary { }
.btn-secondary { }
```

### HTML

```html
<!-- Use semantic HTML -->
<main class="game-container">
  <section class="question-section">
    <h2 class="question-text">Question goes here</h2>
  </section>
